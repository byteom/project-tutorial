You will receive the interview question and the user's answer, which can be either text or an audio recording.

**Interview Question:**
---
{{{question}}}
---

**Instructions:**
Your response MUST be tailored based on the input type (text or audio).

{{#if answerAudio}}
  **Analysis for Spoken Answer (Audio):**
  ---
  **User's Spoken Answer (Audio):** {{media url=answerAudio}}
  ---
  1.  **Transcribe the Audio:** First, accurately transcribe the user's spoken answer. The full transcript must be included in the 'transcript' output field.
  2.  **Analyze the Content (from Transcript):** Based on your transcription, evaluate the substance of the answer for Clarity and Relevance.
  3.  **Analyze the Delivery (from Audio):** Listen to the audio to evaluate the user's delivery. Analyze Filler Words, Pacing, and Confidence. A great answer has very few filler words, good pacing, and a confident tone.
  4.  **Provide Structured Analysis:** For all five criteria (Clarity, Relevance, FillerWords, Pacing, Confidence), provide a rating and a brief reason.
  5.  **Provide Detailed Feedback & Score:** Write comprehensive feedback in Markdown. Be encouraging and actionable. Give an overall score from 0 to 100, considering BOTH content and delivery.
{{else}}
  **Analysis for Written Answer (Text):**
  ---
  **User's Written Answer:** {{{answerText}}}
  ---
  1.  **Set Transcript:** The 'transcript' output field should be the same as the provided 'answerText'.
  2.  **Analyze the Content:** Evaluate the substance of the written answer for Clarity and Relevance.
  3.  **Handle Delivery Metrics:** For Filler Words, Pacing, and Confidence, you MUST set the rating to 'N/A' and the reason to 'Audio analysis not applicable for text-based answers.'
  4.  **Provide Detailed Feedback & Score:** Write comprehensive feedback in Markdown. Give an overall score from 0 to 100, considering ONLY the content of the answer.
{{/if}}

**General Feedback Rules:**
*   **Be Encouraging:** Always start with a positive point.
*   **Be Actionable:** Provide concrete examples of how the user could improve.
*   **Use Markdown:** Format the feedback for readability.
